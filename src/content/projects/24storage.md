24Storage is a company that rents out storage units to both individuals and businesses through what is known as self-storage. The company was founded in 2015 with the vision to digitalize the storage industry. Rentals are made both through customer service and the company's website. Today, 24Storage has 23 facilities around the country, over 10,000 storage units, and over 6,000 customers. At the end of 2019, 24Storage was listed on the First North stock exchange. Rhyme has had a long-standing collaboration with 24Storage and was involved in developing their current website from scratch.

The project consisted of redeveloping and maintaining the 24Storage website in a new, more modern framework, React. This meant for Karl to learn a new framework and new tools, as well as gaining a complete understanding of 24Storage and its vision. Initially, Karl was primarily responsible for the creative and styling of the entire site, working together with both the designer and marketing manager for 24Storage.

The vision was to be Sweden's first online-based self-storage solution, where Karl played a part in realizing the user experience of this vision. Karl was also involved in developing key parts of the functionality. Users would receive suggestions for storage units based on their location, and could find the nearest storage unit based on where they were. The goal included a portal where customers could manage all their storage-related matters without having to leave the comfort of their home.

At 24Storage, Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager were also used to collect information about each booking made, to provide valuable information to 24Storage's management.
The site was built from scratch in React with the help of Redux, and the site's content was delivered through a headless CMS, Prismic. Karl was primarily responsible for content management and building the site around it to provide a good overall experience.

For a long period, Karl acted as the lead developer on the project, responsible for communication with designers and management to best turn the fundamental vision into reality. He has also been highly involved in driving 24Storage towards a more modern technical stance.

_24Storage has since been merged with Green Storage._
