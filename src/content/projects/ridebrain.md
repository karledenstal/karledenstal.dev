Ridebrain is a web and app-based hub for extreme sports created by and for skiers and snowboarders worldwide. It is a social network with user-generated and proprietary content, where leading professional riders can connect with their fans and share tips, tricks, and their favorite resorts. It's also for regular skiers and snowboarders looking to find new friends with the same interest or new cool skis to try out for the upcoming season.

Karl worked on Ridebrain's web-based platform and e-commerce, supporting the existing team. His main tasks involved setting up dynamic content using GraphCMS, and developing a functioning form to help customers receive product recommendations based on their form entries.

This was done with the intention of finding the correct or best gear for the user and promote affiliate stores. The site was built in Next.js and React and used GraphCMS as their CMS together with GraphQL.
