ProjectPartner is a Stockholm based Project Management Company consisting of multiple project management consultants on a mission to become Mälardalens most sought-after and competent project management company. With over 20 years of experience they are involved in several key projects in the region with clients such as Swedavia Airports, Swedish Trafikverket and Stockholms Länstrafik. 

Karl was responsible for the development of the company's website, built in Wordpress. The site was built from scratch and was designed to be a simple and informative site for the company's clients and potential clients. The site was built with a custom theme to handle the company's projects and consultants. Karl was also responsible for the site's maintenance and updates. 

_This was done as Karl's examination project during the last year of his studies._
