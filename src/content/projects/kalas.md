Kalas is an innovator in digital event management, in the early stages of development, with the ambition to transform event planning through a comprehensive digital platform. The platform is designed to simplify the creation of events, distribution of unique invitations, and communities for users.

Karl has been responsible for the design and implementation of a scalable and secure REST API in Typescript. The API facilitates critical functions including user authentication (OAuth2), authorization, roles and policies, management of events and guest lists, as well as invitations via email.

Karl implemented a strict type safety model to ensure robustness and facilitate scalability and further development of the platform.
