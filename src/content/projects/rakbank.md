Rakbank is a commercial bank based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The bank operates through a network of 39 branches catering to consumers, SMEs, and large corporations. Initially a dedicated corporate bank, Rakbank has, since the early 2000s, sought to establish a stronger position as a consumer bank as well.

Rhyme was tasked with redesigning Rakbank's banking app and modernizing it to provide customers with a portal where they could efficiently manage all their banking needs. Besides achieving a sleek flow, such as displaying the customer's bank accounts and cards, the app was also designed to offer a simple method of transfer and clear oversight.

The app was built in React Native, allowing Karl to easily develop both Android and iOS versions simultaneously, with all data coming from an existing API in Dubai. Together with a design team, Karl worked on delivering a modern appearance that would utilize visual animations and sound to offer customers a simple and clear experience in the app. All data was secured and came from an existing API in Dubai, which entailed considerable work with privacy and security.

Karl held a frontend lead developer role in the project and was responsible for the majority of its delivery. He established both a functional and intelligent flow using a navigation library and a clear and sleek way to navigate between account cards, bank accounts, settings, and transfer methods. The team worked together agilely according to Scrum.
