Tandläkare.se offers a comparison service for dental care, where the majority of Sweden's private dental clinics are connected. It serves as a hub where people can compare clinics against each other, but most importantly, find and book an appointment at the nearest and best dental clinic when they need to visit the dentist. Tandläkare.se began taking shape around 2014/2015, and during that time, many developers have passed through, both beginners and more experienced ones. While the mission has involved the need to maintain and ensure that both hardware and software continue to run smoothly, the client also wanted to make major changes and improvements, both to the systems and the product.

Karl is part of a development team of 3 people, focusing on rebuilding the entire website based on new design and technology. The task involves moving away from the old and introducing something that works better. This specifically means migrating away from PHP and replacing it with Golang/Go and React in the frontend, all while building according to the new design created by an external design agency.

As the lead developer, Karl is responsible for the development of the new booking widget used externally by the clinics connected to Tandläkare.se. Karl is also responsible for leading the development team, collecting and providing feedback, planning upcoming goals, being available as a mentor to junior developers, and establishing processes.
