Ericsson is one of the world's largest manufacturers of equipment for building mobile communication networks. It is a Swedish company with an international focus that operates in research, development, sales, production, and administration.

Karl was part of a large cross-functional team dedicated to realizing Ericsson's Digital Transformation. The solution Karl worked on is a portal for Ericsson's customers that includes tools for managing invoices and products. While it provides an overview of the products and services customers pay for, it also becomes a way for Ericsson to upsell. As part of its digital transformation, Ericsson also aims to follow in Microsoft's footsteps and create a subscription-based sales model, instead of a license-based one.

Karl was quickly given the lead on one of these use cases that handles software subscriptions and a variety of data. The project is set up in React and primarily uses Typescript to make the code readable and facilitate debugging. Karl took over the project from a previous developer and has since rebuilt major parts to improve and optimize the product.

The team works agilely according to scrum with daily standups and sprints. Karl was given early responsibility as the team's sole frontend developer and was instrumental in presenting the frontend perspective in problem-solving, requirement specification, and estimating tasks in close collaboration with the team's other cross-functional members.

Karl's main responsibilities have been to come up with and work on user-friendly solutions, build up a platform using data from internal APIs, and deliver all frontend development on the project. He has also developed and maintains an internal NPM library for the project that handles authentication and collected components for all projects within Ericsson's Digital Transformation.

In 2021, Karl took on a leading role within Lighthouse 10 Software Asset Management and was responsible for all frontend parts of the project. This involved setting up structure, working methods, and processes, as well as onboarding new developers and leading the development work for the application.
