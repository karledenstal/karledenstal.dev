# karledenstal.dev

This is my personal website, where I publish blog posts, projects I've worked on and other things I might find interesting. 

The website is built with the following technologies:

- [Astro](https://astro.build)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [React](https://react.dev)

But Astro and its built-in Content Collections are at the core of the website.
